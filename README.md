# Welcome to the C++ Workshop Session 05/03/25

## About

In this session, you are encouraged to ask for support with areas of C++ that
you are having difficulties with. Be it functions, file IO operations, classes,
inheritance, pointers or more, this is a chance to do so!

Below will be some resources targeted towards these areas, in an attempt to
give you something you can look back on in your own time to give a bit of 
support.

And remember, we cannot help you directly with your coursework. But we can give
you all the skills you will need to do it. So make sure your questions are 
generalised. Try and identify the issue you are having in your coursework, and 
focus upon that particular element.


### A Bit of Advice

If you ever find yourself stuck, get googling! Decompose your problem into the
core issue and search for that issue. Stack Overflow will likely be the best
place for answers. Similarly, documentation sites such as [CPPReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
are brilliant when you are working with specific functions or libraries.
(Similar documentation sites exist for [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage)
and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-index.html))

You can also do the same with any error codes the terminal sends back at you. 
Finding out 0xC0000005 is actually a memory access violation can help you 
determine where an error may be occurring.
